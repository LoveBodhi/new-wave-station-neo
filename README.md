Note: This overhaul should be 100% libre, copyright-safe real instrument samples / presets. For sample feedback/contribution, please don't give me:

1. Sound module samples (aka Romplers), as they're copyrighted;
2. Unauthorized or pirated CC0/PD samples;
3. Unrealistic instrument samples (e.g. Resynthesized with synthesizers);
4. Presets that re-synthesized with realistic samples, another sort of unrealistic.
